                    Rogan and company didn't do anything but set out to make a funny movie, and they were reasonably successful. The filmmakers were just artists doing their job, until they got swept up in something bigger. Maybe that's how art is supposed to work.

                    These aren't just two stoner dudes who bumbled their way into a real world crisis like in the movie, these are two very smart comedians who turned a seemingly innocuous comedy into a real life act of defiance.

                    Headlines strained to politicize the film. But it's merely a crass, caustic comedy whose point of view is to not let cultural coverage brainwash the best out of us - whether it involves human rights or celebrity hairpieces.

                    The Interview may have benefited in investing more energy in compiling a stronger supporting cast -- this would have at least allowed the humour to potentially branch out and find new gags that unfortunately weren't present.

                    There's a good point to be made about how journalists can be co-opted by access to the powerful people they're supposed to be holding accountable. Unfortunately, Rogen and Goldberg aren't the filmmakers to make this point.
